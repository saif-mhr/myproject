            <h1><b>History of Hyderabad</b></h1>
            <hr style="border:1px solid red" />
            <p class="text-justify">
                Hyderābād City (Haidarābād) (Sindhi: حیدرآباد‎, Urdu: حیدرآباد‎ ), headquarters of the district of Sindh province of Pakistan traces its
                early history to Neroon,[1][2] a Sindhi ruler of the area from whom the city derived its previous name,
                Neroon Kot. Its history dates back to medieval times, when Ganjo Takker (Barren Hill), a nearby hilly tract,
                was used as a place of worship. Lying on the most northern hill of the Ganjo Takker ridge, just east of the river
                Indus, it is the third largest city in the province and the eighth largest in the country with an expanse over three
                hillocks part of the most northerly hills of the Ganjo Takker range, 32 miles east of the Indus with which it is connected
                by various routes leading to Gidu Bandar.<br />

                <b class="text-uppercase"><u>Hyderabad</u></b>..<br /> as the historic capital of Sindh, is the centre of all the provincial communications:
                road, rail, waterways and air. From the date of its foundation (1768), its manufactures-ornamented silks,
                silver- and gold-work, and lacquered ware-have been the chief in the province, and during its heyday had gained
                prizes at the industrial exhibitions of Europe. Some noteworthy antiquities are the tombs' of the Kalhora jagirani and Talpur rulers..<br />

                <b class="text-uppercase"><u>The Kalhora dynasty</u> </b><br />
                The River Indus was changing course around 1757 due to Monsoons resulting in periodic floods and devastating the banks of the river.
                Mian Ghulam Shah Kalhora was admired as the saintly ruler of Sindh at the time his capital Khudabad near Dadu was repeatedly flooded.
                Being fed up, he decided to move his capital to a better place.
                The present day city of Hyderabad was founded in 1768 on the site of the ancient town of Neroon Kot by Ghulam Shah Kalhora
                of the Kalhora Dynasty it remained the chief town of Sindh until 1843, when, after the battle of Miani, it surrendered to the British,
                and the capital was transferred to Karachi.[4] It was named after the prophet Mohammed's son-in-law, Ali, also known as Haidar.
                Surviving as a small fishing village on the banks of River Indus, the city was suddenly called the heart of the Mehran.
                Thriving upon the fresh river water's banks, Hyderabad was much loved by Ghulam Shah. He admired the city so much that in 1766,
                he ordered a fort to be built on one of the three hills of Hyderabad to house and defend his people. The massive half-a-square kilometer
                (about 36 acres) garrison was completed by 1768. Since then, it stands in place and is called the Pacco Qillo پڪو قلعو or the strong fort.
                The Kalhora rule lasted for two more decades until the demise of the great Ghulam Shah.<br />

                <b class="text-uppercase"><u> The Talpur kingdom</u></b><br />
                After the death of the great Kalhora, started Talpur Rule. Mian Ghulam Shah Kalhoro's period is considered to be the Golden period in the history of Sindh.
                Later the Kalhora behaved as incompetent rulers and Sindh was ruined under Mian Abdun-Nabi Kalhoro. Mir Fateh Ali Khan Talpur left his capital Khudabad,
                the land of God and made Hyderabad his capital in 1789. Great celebrations were held in 1792 to mark his formal entry in the Hyderabad fort. He made the
                Pacco Qillo his residence and also held his courts there. Mir Fateh Ali Khan Talpur along with his three other brothers was responsible for the affairs
                that persisted in the city of Hyderabad in the years of their kingdom. The four were called Chār Yār, Sindhi for four friends. The rulers of Sindh were
                named Ameers, Arabic for leaders. A portion of the population of Khudabad migrated to the new capital, including Sonaras, Amils and Bhaibands. Those groups
                retained the term Khudabadi in the names of their communities as an identifier of origin.
                It remained the capital of Sindh under the Talpur rulers who succeeded the Kalhoras till 1843, a rule lasting almost half-a-century when Talpurs faced a
                greater threat – the British. The last remaining rule of the Talpur kingdom was Mir Muhammad Naseer Khan Talpur (pictured right) was among the Talpur leaders
                to surrender to the British and was ported to Calcutta in what is now India. Many Talpur Mirs died there during many years of confinement in a small area near
                Calcutta. The bodies of the Talpur Mirs who died there were brought back to Hyderabad when all Mirs were allowed to return to Sindh. These Mirs were buried in the
                tombs located at the northern edge of the Ganjo Hill.
                For these Mirs, they embraced the local culture and tried to proceed it with building literary institutions to restore the integrity of the Sindhi culture.
                In order to educate their people the mother of Mir Fateh Ali Khan, Bibi Khairunnissa, established Jamia al-Khairi or al-Khairi University.<br />
                <b class="text-uppercase"><u>The colonial rule</u> </b><br />
                The history of the British occupation is taken mostly from the Imperial Gazetteer of India, written over a century ago during British rule.
                The British came face-to-face with the Talpurs at the battle of Miani on 17 February 1843. It is said that even in rigor mortis the Ameers (Mirs)
                held their swords high fighting the British. The battle ended on 24 March where the Mirs lost and the city came into the hands of the British.
                The battle at Dabo landed an even greater part of Sindh in the laps of the British regime and the city surrendered to the British. Being the last
                stronghold in the way of the British, the city once conquered, completed the British Conquest of Sindh.
                The crown of being a capital of the emirate of Sindh was then transferred to Karachi when the British general Sir Charles Napier conquered Sindh in 1843,
                mainly because the East India Company had headquarters in Karachi.
                The residency, memorable for its defence by Sir James Outram against the Baluchis in 1843, which was situated 3 miles from Hyderabad, no longer exists.
                The municipality of Hyderabad was established in 1853.
                In the Pacco Qillo the British kept the arsenal of the province, transferred from Karachi in 1861, and the palaces of the ex-Amirs of Sind that they had taken over.
                In 1857, when the Indian mutiny raged across the South Asia, the British held most of their regiments and ammunition in this city. The garrison at the fort composed
                of British and Native infantry, 2 batteries of artillery, and an ammunition column. The barracks were built in twelve blocks, with hospitals, bazar and various amenities
                to the north-west of the city..<br />

                The British demolished most of the buildings around the time of the mutiny to accommodate their troops and their military stores and fused the arsenal in the Pacco
                Qillo so that the people wouldn't use that against them. Evidently the city received the very first blow to its glorious name. No longer were the roads washed with
                sandalwood perfume and rose-water.<br />

                The British however tallied the population statistics of the city in the years to come to keep an accurate record of the growth. Populations statistics dating back
                to 1872 compliment the tremendous growth the city achieved within a few decades. From 43,088 (1872), 48,153 (1881), 58,048 (1891) to 69,378 (1901), the city grew in
                thousands. At this point in time the Hinduism was the most dominant religion with 43,499 followers mostly linked to trade while 24,831 Muslims made up the largest
                ethnic minority. The 710 Christians were mostly new converts or the British soldiers in regiments around the town. The city ranked seventh in the Bombay Presidency
                in terms of population.<br />

                Also included in the census figures were income and expenditure, the average income during the decade ending 1901 was Rs. 220,000. In 1903-4 the income and expenditure
                amounted to 270,000 and 280,000 respectively. The chief sources of income were octroi (Rs. 1,30,000) and water rate (Rs. 22,000); and the chief heads of expenditure
                were general administration and collection of taxes (Rs. 39,000), public safety (Rs. 7,400), water-supply and drainage (RS. 22,000), conservancy (Rs. 37,000), hospitals
                and dispensaries (Rs. 15,000), public works (Rs. 13,000), and education (Rs. 18,000). The income of the cantonment fund in 1903-4 was Rs. 43,000, and the expenditure
                Rs. 33,800.<br />

                The British devised a rail network throughout the western part of the then South Asia and purchased the private Scinde Railway (Sinds railway) to connect to the Kabul
                trade routes. The rail network would later be called the North-Western State Railway in 1886. Hyderabad was a major junction on the line linking distant trade locations
                like Lahore and still is to date.<br />

                To facilitate the expansion of the former capital, the British deployed water pumping technologies that would pump water from the river bank at Gidu Bandar whence
                from the water was deposited into large reservoirs situated about 500 yards from the river bank capable of holding over 1,000,000 gallons of water, surely a first
                when it comes to state-of-the-art constructions. Using a smart gravitational concept, the water was then supplied to the far most arid regions of the town.
